Did you know that when you create a site

0:00:04.673 --> 0:00:06.395
for your team, a shared notebook

0:00:06.396 --> 0:00:07.970
is automatically added?

0:00:07.971 --> 0:00:10.376
This is a fantastic collaboration tool

0:00:10.377 --> 0:00:14.084
to capture, compile, and share information.

0:00:14.085 --> 0:00:16.066
Let’s open one.

0:00:17.637 --> 0:00:18.838
All members of the team site

0:00:18.839 --> 0:00:20.710
can use the notebook.

0:00:20.711 --> 0:00:23.480
People can take notes,
insert text and pictures,

0:00:23.481 --> 0:00:25.363
and even record audio and video -

0:00:25.364 --> 0:00:28.466
all together at the same time.

0:00:31.884 --> 0:00:34.634
In addition, teammates
using Office can open

0:00:34.635 --> 0:00:36.982
and sync the notebook
on their local desktop

0:00:36.983 --> 0:00:40.083
by clicking Open in OneNote.

0:00:42.604 --> 0:00:44.662
Plus, they can send back reports or notes

0:00:44.663 --> 0:00:46.433
through email

0:00:48.659 --> 0:00:50.533
and insert meeting information from their

0:00:50.534 --> 0:00:54.933
Outlook calendar - all in one single click.

0:00:57.575 --> 0:01:00.256
Finally, team members can access and sync

0:01:00.257 --> 0:01:03.067
the notebook on multiple devices.

0:01:03.068 --> 0:01:04.864
This way, your shared notes are available

0:01:04.865 --> 0:01:07.342
from virtually anywhere and stay in sync

0:01:07.343 --> 0:01:10.300
across devices.
