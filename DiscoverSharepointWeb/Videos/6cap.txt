0:00:05.392 --> 0:00:07.532
Now let me walk you
through the site mailbox

0:00:07.533 --> 0:00:09.275
and calendars.

0:00:09.276 --> 0:00:12.389
Let's start with the site mailbox.

0:00:12.390 --> 0:00:15.911
Email plays a crucial role
in everyday communication.

0:00:15.912 --> 0:00:18.143
But while it lets us share
important information,

0:00:18.144 --> 0:00:20.423
it sometimes excludes other team members

0:00:20.424 --> 0:00:22.352
from the conversation.

0:00:22.353 --> 0:00:24.525
The site mailbox can help all teammates

0:00:24.526 --> 0:00:26.351
instantly get on the same page

0:00:26.352 --> 0:00:29.167
by simply using a shared inbox.

0:00:29.168 --> 0:00:32.397
Here, I can access the
site mailbox from our site

0:00:32.398 --> 0:00:35.813
and see our emails in the Outlook Web App.

0:00:35.814 --> 0:00:39.208
Notice that when I switch to Outlook,

0:00:39.209 --> 0:00:42.914
the site mailbox is
synchronized with Outlook,

0:00:42.915 --> 0:00:46.367
along with my personal inbox.

0:00:46.368 --> 0:00:48.806
Now what's really useful here is that I can

0:00:48.807 --> 0:00:51.527
drag an email from my personal inbox

0:00:51.528 --> 0:00:53.532
and drop it in the site mailbox,

0:00:53.533 --> 0:00:55.372
giving everyone on my team access

0:00:55.373 --> 0:00:58.663
to this message at the same time.

0:00:58.664 --> 0:01:01.325
It works the same way with attachments:

0:01:01.326 --> 0:01:03.187
drag an attachment from an email

0:01:03.188 --> 0:01:05.874
into the documents folder,
and it automatically

0:01:05.875 --> 0:01:10.214
syncs with the site's document library.

0:01:10.215 --> 0:01:11.670
Let's head back to the team site

0:01:11.671 --> 0:01:13.223
and view the updates I've made

0:01:13.224 --> 0:01:16.549
in the site mailbox and document library.

0:01:16.550 --> 0:01:19.992
So here we have the new email

0:01:19.993 --> 0:01:22.705
and the attachment.

0:01:22.706 --> 0:01:25.376
Let's move on to calendars.

0:01:25.377 --> 0:01:27.982
You can use calendars to
keep everyone up to date

0:01:27.983 --> 0:01:30.325
on upcoming meetings and travel.

0:01:30.326 --> 0:01:32.117
And, just like with emails,

0:01:32.118 --> 0:01:35.993
calendars can be synchronized
directly inside Outlook.

0:01:35.994 --> 0:01:39.026
When I click Connect to Outlook,

0:01:39.027 --> 0:01:41.002
the team calendar syncs with Outlook

0:01:41.003 --> 0:01:43.151
and appears under Other Calendars

0:01:43.152 --> 0:01:45.263
in my calendar folder.

0:01:45.264 --> 0:01:47.120
Note how my personal calendar

0:01:47.121 --> 0:01:49.549
and the team site calendar can be seen

0:01:49.550 --> 0:01:52.647
together in side-by-side view.

0:01:52.648 --> 0:01:55.717
This view is especially helpful
for organizing meetings

0:01:55.718 --> 0:01:59.600
while keeping an eye out
for scheduling conflicts.

0:02:00.649 --> 0:02:04.642
Now let's go back to the team site calendar

0:02:04.643 --> 0:02:06.317
and see that my changes in Outlook

0:02:06.318 --> 0:02:08.699
are automatically synchronized.
