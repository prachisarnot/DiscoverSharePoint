0:00:05.469 --> 0:00:08.301
As task lists grow in size and complexity

0:00:08.302 --> 0:00:10.036
into full-fledged projects,

0:00:10.037 --> 0:00:11.718
you can save yourself from overload

0:00:11.719 --> 0:00:15.059
by launching Project
Professional from your site.

0:00:15.060 --> 0:00:18.489
As Garth, I'm now leading
a marketing campaign.

0:00:18.490 --> 0:00:21.537
I want to use Project as
my main management tool

0:00:21.538 --> 0:00:24.251
and SharePoint to keep
everyone on the same page.

0:00:24.252 --> 0:00:26.266
So I set up a sync.

0:00:26.267 --> 0:00:28.403
From the Marketing Campaign project site,

0:00:28.404 --> 0:00:32.604
I click Tasks, and then click List

0:00:32.605 --> 0:00:34.306
on the menu bar.

0:00:34.307 --> 0:00:37.777
From there, I click Open with Project.

0:00:37.787 --> 0:00:40.465
Now I can manage task dependencies,

0:00:40.466 --> 0:00:42.966
balance resource allocations,

0:00:42.967 --> 0:00:47.500
and generate rich out-of-the-box
reports with ease.

0:00:51.610 --> 0:00:53.500
When I'm finished, I can sync everything

0:00:53.501 --> 0:00:55.638
back to my site, where
the team can continue

0:00:55.639 --> 0:00:58.766
to work together and stay in sync.
