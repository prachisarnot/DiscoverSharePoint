Now let's take a look at Power View.

0:00:04.629 --> 0:00:06.708
You can use Power View to gain valuable

0:00:06.709 --> 0:00:10.176
insights into your data and
make better decisions.

0:00:10.177 --> 0:00:12.547
I need to figure out how
effective my marketing

0:00:12.548 --> 0:00:16.115
campaign was across a 12-month period.

0:00:16.116 --> 0:00:18.626
I open the campaign spreadsheet

0:00:21.207 --> 0:00:24.542
and click one of the blue
bars at the top right.

0:00:25.117 --> 0:00:27.123
This filters my dashboard to display

0:00:27.124 --> 0:00:30.411
the sales revenue, sales
quantity, and margins

0:00:30.412 --> 0:00:33.124
for each brand in my campaign.

0:00:33.125 --> 0:00:35.032
To see how revenue and sales changed

0:00:35.033 --> 0:00:38.142
over the months, I click Play.

0:00:38.143 --> 0:00:40.256
This gives us a full view of how the sales

0:00:40.257 --> 0:00:43.132
numbers changed over time.

0:00:43.133 --> 0:00:45.099
We can even take a closer look at the data

0:00:45.100 --> 0:00:46.911
by zooming in on the scatter plot

0:00:46.912 --> 0:00:49.888
to see all the details.
